# Project-3
For teacher a video is provided where I show functions of this REST API working
I used some online tutorials to come up with the idea of seperate folders and files inside the backend folder to make the code look more neat and trimmed
It clearly is missing all the frontend functions but currently is in working state to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE items
